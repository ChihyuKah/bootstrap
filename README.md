#Bootstrap

<h3>Dec 3</h3>

9:00 Working on exercise 1: trying to get the colums right size (width and height)<br>
12:20 Structure of the colums is fine, Now figuring it out the right height problem but it was solved. Because the              height of the colum comes from the colum with the biggest content.


<h3>Dec 4</h3>
- Took a realy long time to find the right classes. mostly done with trail and error and a lot of reading in the Bootstrap
  Documentation. I feel more comfortable using it now.
- It feels good when you accomplish something. I feel good about assignment 2 it took a lot of tinkering but in the end I have
  a feeling of satisfaction.
